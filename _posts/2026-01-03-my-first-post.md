# Hello world!

This is my first blog post, and it features **Markdown formatting**.

## What you can do:

1.  **Bold** and *Italic* text.
2.  Create [links](https://jekyllrb.com).
3.  Write code:
    ```python
    print("Hello from Jekyll!")
    ```

> "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents."

Enjoy your new blog!
